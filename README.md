Research topics in Numerical Relativity:

- Evolution of space-times with scalar-field as matter field with and without potencial;
- 3+1 and BSSN formalism of Einstein equations;
- Use of different gauge conditions. In our case: Maximal slicing e K-driver;
- Spectral methods as numerical aproach. We can stepforward and use for example Domain Decomposition technique;
- Studyn of critical phenomena of gravitacional colapse;
- 2D and 3D visualization data. Plots, animation, gifs, etc
